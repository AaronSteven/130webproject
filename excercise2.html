my attempt solution flow: 
   1. Button creates a new file using simple file stream and send the location as a JSON object
   2. Use post to send location to the sever, and use echo to return that value 
   3. Loading the JSON file. I would send the location info as a JSON object. I would stringify to send, then decode to work with. Then encodce to send it back as I echo it. Alternatively I will send it to a new file that will hold that location JSON file.
